    <h2>Content</h2>

    <h3>Products</h3>
    <p> This page will consist of all the products that I have available on my etsy site.
      It will esentially be a massive photo gallery of my 200+ designs. Since there is so many pictures,
      I will add a searching feature so visitors can directly look for a certain musical artist or tv show.
      The photos themselves will be links that will redirect the vistor to the specific listing on the etsy website.
      Since I have so many pictues I will be using, here are 2 of the listings pictures that I will be showing off.

        <img class="once-img" src="images/once.avif" alt="Once Standee"/>
    </div>  
    
    <h2>How it's Made</h2>
    <p>
      This page will show the process of how I made my products. Not only do I want to show pictures and videos of the 3d printer itself, I can go through the process of how I make the stands
      in my 3d modeling software. It will be almost like a step by step tutorial of how it would go if a customer
      were to buy a design that dosen't already exsist. Also as part of "how its made" I can include pictures of my work Space
      so vistors can really grasp how i am managing a bussiness myself out of a dorm room.

  </div>  
    
  <h2>Materials</h2>
  <p>
    The materials page will be where I show what materials I use in my shop. And I mean EVERY type of material. So i will include pictures and links
    to the pla filament that I use, The type of printer itself, bussiness cards, bubble mailers and chemicals. I will also explain how certain materials 
    are used, for example, I use 100% acetone to melt the plastic and smooth out any flaws. This section will also include information like how the filament is enviromentally friendly and 
    decomposes in water over time.
